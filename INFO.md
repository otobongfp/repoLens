# RepoLens – Info, Milestones & Vision

RepoLens exists to help humans **get better, faster, in the age of AI**.  
It’s a self-paced, AI-powered learning platform — not the usual instructor-led flow.  
By turning **repos into textbooks** and **AI into a mentor**, RepoLens creates an environment where learning is hands-on, adaptive, and future-ready.

Think of it as _“GitHub meets Khan Academy”_ — where **open-source projects become living classrooms**.

## Vision

- **For Learners** – learn at your own pace, with AI guiding you through real codebases.
- **For Developers** – gain instant insights, feedback, and refactoring suggestions.
- **For Communities** – unlock shared growth by learning from open-source together.

RepoLens is about building a system where **practice, exploration, and feedback** fuel continuous improvement, without waiting for a teacher, bootcamp, or course.

## Milestones (Requirements)

### Phase 1 – Core Repo Analysis

- [x] Upload / link GitHub repo
- [x] Parse repo structure via Rust Agent
- [x] Generate knowledge graph (files, functions, imports)
- [x] Visualizations (graph, tree, dependency matrix, flow, heatmap)
- [x] AI insights: complexity, maintainability, security

### Phase 2 – Interactive Exploration

- [x] Ask questions about a repo (AI-powered Q&A)
- [ ] Decompose repo into technologies, algorithms, and patterns
- [ ] Auto-generate external learning resource links

### Phase 3 – Learning & Education

- [ ] Task management (create, assign, grade coding exercises)
- [ ] Automated scoring (tests, style checks, AI eval)
- [ ] Learning paths (adaptive 2-month microlearning journeys)
- [ ] Progress dashboards for learners

### Phase 4 – Collaboration & Community

- [ ] Educator dashboards & assignment tools
- [ ] Peer review integration (human + AI)
- [ ] Public learner community with repo-based challenges

## Long-Term Goals

- **RepoLens as a Microlearning LMS** – anyone can learn from real repos in a structured, adaptive way.
- **Open Knowledge Graph of Code** – building the world’s largest map of repos, technologies, and learning resources.
- **Gamified Learning** – badges, achievements, and streaks to motivate consistent progress.
- **Global Education Impact** – enabling schools, bootcamps, and self-learners worldwide.

## How to Contribute

- Check issues labeled **good first issue** or **help wanted**.
- Improve repo analysis accuracy, visualization, or UI.
- Share feedback on the repo → learning pipeline.

## Current Focus (as of August 2025)

- Refining repo decomposition → **learning graph**.
- Expanding **AI Q&A** reliability and context awareness.
- Designing the foundation of **adaptive learning paths**.
